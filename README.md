# vorp_stealing

- This script allows you to steal items from players when they are hogtied.

- Walk up to the tied player and press G to search him

Known Issues: 
 - After searching a character, the previous menu is overlaid on top of the new one. (urgent fix required)
 
  Temporary solution to the problem: the character will be in a state of freeze while the menu is open. The menu will have to be opened again after using one of the keys. This is to ensure that the menus do not overlap.
