# vorp_stealing

- This script allows you to steal items from players when they are hogtied.

- Walk up to the tied player and press G to search him

Known Issues: 
 - After searching a character, the previous menu is overlaid on top of the new one. (urgent fix required)
 - If the player is dead it cannot be searched
