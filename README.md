# vorp_stealing

- This script allows you to steal items from players when they are hogtied.

- Walk up to the tied player and press G to search him

Known Issues: 
 - After searching a character, the previous menu is overlaid on top of the new one. (urgent fix required)
 
  Temporary solution to the problem: close the menu manually, and do not leave the player, so that the menu does not overlap
  
 - If the player is dead it cannot be searched
